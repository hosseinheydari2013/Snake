# Snake
**Traditional Snake Game Written in C++**

The game starts with a small snake in a 2D domain. As time passes random food particles will be thrown to the domain. When a player collects a food particle, the size of the snake gets bigger. This version is a bit robust and modifications still can be done to make it look better. However, this is an error-free version of the game.

Note that visualization of the snake game is done using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). So, the user is supposed to be able to correctly setup a working environment with the aforementioned library. Moreover, I did not add the SFML lib files here because I was not sure about the licensing policy. However, you may easily download it for free from "https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php".
